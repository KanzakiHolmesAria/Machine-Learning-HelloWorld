Demo For Machine(Deep) Learning
----
## Tool Packages
Numpy_Demo.ipynb introduces some visualizational "hello world" for using numpy.   

Pandas_Demo.ipynb introduces some visualizational "hello world" for using pandas.  

----
## Machine Learning Pipeline
ML_pipeline_Demo.ipynb introduces a visualizational pipeline for solving a problem with machine learning (boosting) method, including:
1. EDA
2. data prepare and clean
3. feature engine
4. modeling, adjust hyperparameters and stacking
5. review train and valid results, check feature importance  

By this way, you can easily set up a baseline.
